# Introduction
Today, I'm super excited to dive into my personal neovim configuration built with Lua. Just so you know, I'm running this on Linux Mint at work and Manjaro when I'm chilling at home. But depending on your OS or distribution, your mileage might vary just a bit.

My current setup? Well, it's a refined fork from the Purple school channel – shout out to them! (Check the description for the base video link).

I remember starting my neovim journey with a configuration from the didjitalize channel. To be frank, it was a tough nut to crack, especially for vim newbies like me – wasn't the smoothest ride.

Then, I stumbled upon astronvim. Oh boy, it had an impressive build and some killer hotkeys! But here's the deal-breaker – it was sluggish with large files and sometimes failed to highlight the middle of files unless you painstakingly scrolled from the top. And guess what? NvChad had a similar hiccup.

Working with Vue on Astro was another challenge. Even after setting up the Vue language server, the highlighting and "go to definition" features were MIA. NvChad, though friendlier with Vue, shared the indexing issue with astro.

Now, I've heard good things about Lunar Nvim and I'm itching to try it out. I gave Lunar's build a whirl just for this video. The plus? Super smooth installation without trashing your previous nvim build. The catch? Its settings are a bit intricate, especially if you're coming from astro or nvchad backgrounds.

So, after all these experiments, here I am with my own build. What's special?

1. Lightning-fast file indexing.
2. Intuitive editing – especially if you're transitioning from astrovim.
3. Beginner-friendly with simple hotkeys.

Alright! Enough chit-chat. Let's dive right into the build!

For those eager to replicate this, I've laid down all the installation steps in my git repository. Just clone it into your "nvim" folder, fire up "nvim", and you're all set!
