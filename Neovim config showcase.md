Hi !
Today I want to show my neovim configuration on lua
I use Linux mint on job and Manjaro at home maybe on different distributes or Os will be different

This config is a fork from Purple school channel
(link on base video in description)

I start my way of neovim with  other configuration from didjitalize channel 

That config was very hard for new users like me and it was a bad experience 

After I fought the astronvim - Awesome build 
and Awesome hotkeys

I was on it about half a year but when I changed my job I fought a problem - big files has a very long time for indexation 

or Middle of file don't have a highlights if I was there after starting file and then I should to go start file and go down very slowly

And The same problem was in Nvchad 

Also I Cannot with Vue on Astro ( i installed vue language server but i have no highlights and i can't use go definition)

Base NvChad work nice with Vue but also like in astro nvchad had a problem with indexing middle in file 

I want to try Lunar Nvim and i'll do this in future
And for this video I'm tried  Lunar build just now)

Feature from lunar - Very easy installing ang you don't need remove your last nvim build!
But Lunar hard in settings, because It's different from astro and nvchad


Because I on my own build  until now

My features :
1. Really fast file indexing 
2. Easy for editing (Especially for astrovim users)
3. Easy for new users in vim and easy hotkeys

Introduction is finished, let's go to build!

Instructions for installing are in git repository
