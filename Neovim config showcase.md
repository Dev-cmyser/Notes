Hi !
Today I want to show my neovim configuration on lua

This config is a fork from Purple school channel
(link on base video in description)

I start my way of neovim with other configuration from didjitalize channel 

That config was very hard for new users like me and it was a bad experience 

After I fought the astronvim - Awesome build 
and Awesome hotkeys

I was on it about half a year but when I changed my job I fought a problem - big files has a very long time for indexation 

or Middle of file dont have a highlights if I was there after starting file and then I should to go start file and go down very slowly

And The same problem was in Nvchad 

Because I on my own build until now

I want to try Lunar Nvim and i'll do this in future
